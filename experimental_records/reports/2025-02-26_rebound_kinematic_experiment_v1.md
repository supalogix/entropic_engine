# Using Rebound’s Symplectic Integrators in a Purely Kinematic Approach  

## Overview  

In this experiment, I set out to determine whether Rebound’s symplectic integrators, typically used for Newtonian N-body simulations, could be applied to a purely kinematic system where motion emerges from energy redistribution rather than explicit force equations. The goal was to see if motion, time evolution, and conservation laws could still hold in a system without explicitly defined forces.  

Instead of defining acceleration through force-based interactions, I tested whether energy conservation and symplectic integration alone could guide system evolution. My approach involved treating computational elements as energy nodes, where energy moves between them in discrete steps, similar to a physical system constrained by conservation laws.

## Adapting Rebound for a Kinematic-Only System  

### 1. Replacing Force-Based Motion with Energy Redistribution  

Normally, Rebound simulates objects interacting through gravitational forces. I replaced forces with an energy transfer model, where each element’s state was dictated by energy flow rather than acceleration.  

To implement this, I defined a set of computational elements where:  
- Instead of treating mass as gravitational mass, I treated it as energy storage.  
- Instead of computing force interactions, I redistributed energy between elements in each time step.  

This was achieved using a function that transfers energy between elements at each integration step:  

```python
def energy_transfer(sim):
    particles = sim.particles
    for i in range(1, len(particles)):  
        delta_energy = 0.01 * particles[i].m  # Small energy transfer
        particles[i].m -= delta_energy
        particles[0].m += delta_energy  # Redistribution to another element
```

By attaching this function to the simulation, energy transfer became the sole driver of state evolution.

### 2. Using Symplectic Integration for Energy Conservation  

Since I wasn’t using force-based motion, I needed a way to ensure long-term stability in energy evolution. Symplectic integration is designed to preserve conserved quantities like energy and angular momentum, so I chose WHFast (a symplectic integrator in Rebound) to maintain stability.  

```python
sim = rebound.Simulation()
sim.integrator = "whfast"  # Symplectic integrator for energy conservation
sim.dt = 1e-3  # Defining a small step size for smooth energy redistribution
```

This ensured that energy was never lost or artificially gained, allowing the system to evolve naturally through energy propagation rather than explicit forces.

### 3. Running the Simulation Without Explicit Time Evolution  

One of the key questions was whether time could emerge naturally from energy dynamics, rather than being imposed externally.  

To test this, I let the system evolve over 100 time units using Rebound’s symplectic integration:  

```python
sim.integrate(100)  # Running the simulation
```

This allowed me to observe whether motion followed a structured evolution without any explicit force-driven accelerations.

### 4. Verifying Energy Conservation and Emergent Motion  

At the end of the experiment, I checked whether total energy remained conserved across all elements:  

```python
for i, p in enumerate(sim.particles):
    print(f"Element {i}: Energy (m) = {p.m}")
```

This confirmed that:  
- Energy was never lost—only redistributed.  
- Motion emerged purely from energy exchanges.  
- No external force definitions were required.

## What I Learned from This Experiment  

1. Energy Redistribution Alone Can Drive Motion  
   - The experiment demonstrated that motion does not require explicit forces—it can emerge purely from energy exchanges between elements.  
   - This supports the idea that in some systems, kinematics can be the foundation of dynamics, rather than the other way around.  

2. Symplectic Integration Ensures Stability Without a Force Model  
   - Even without forces, Rebound’s symplectic integrators preserved total energy, proving they can be adapted beyond standard Hamiltonian physics.  

3. Time Evolution Can Emerge from Energy Motion  
   - The simulation progressed naturally without requiring an externally imposed clock, suggesting that time itself may be a consequence of energy movement rather than an independent parameter.  

4. This Approach Could Extend to Other Physics Simulations  
   - This method could be useful for simulating emergent physics, such as:  
     - General relativity (where geodesics replace force equations).  
     - Quantum mechanics (where energy exchange determines state evolution).  
     - Computational models where time is not fundamental but arises from interactions.

## Next Steps  

This experiment showed that Rebound’s symplectic integrators can be successfully adapted to kinematic-only simulations, but I want to expand on this further:  

- Explore more complex energy redistribution rules to see how different transfer models affect motion patterns.  
- Test other symplectic integrators (e.g., SEI or IAS15) to compare performance in this type of system.  
- Apply this approach to multi-agent systems to study emergent behaviors in physics-inspired computational models.  

I believe this suggests that we can open new doors for computational physics and alternative simulation frameworks where motion, time, and state transitions emerge naturally from energy interactions alone.
