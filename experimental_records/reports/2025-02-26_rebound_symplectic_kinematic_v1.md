# Exploring Rebound’s Symplectic Integrators in a Purely Kinematic Approach  

## Whitepaper Report on an Experimental Computational Model  

## 1. Overview  

### Objective
- Test if Rebound’s symplectic integrators can work in a purely kinematic Lagrangian system.  
- Replace force-based motion with energy redistribution and observe if motion, time evolution, and conservation laws still hold.  

### Why This Matters
- Traditional Use of Symplectic Integration:
  - Preserves energy and phase-space volume in Hamiltonian systems (e.g., N-body gravitational simulations).  
- Our Experiment:
  - Investigates if energy-driven motion can emerge without forces.  
  - Tests if conservation laws and least-action principles still hold.  
- Key Questions:
  - Can symplectic integration track energy transfers without explicit force laws?  
  - Can time and motion emerge naturally from energy redistribution?

## 2. Original Experiment: Standard Use of Rebound in N-Body Simulations  

### Baseline Setup  
- Used Rebound’s WHFast integrator (Wisdom-Holman mapping).  
- Simulated three gravitationally interacting bodies.  
- Measured total system energy over time.  

### Observations  
- Energy and angular momentum were conserved across long simulations.  
- Objects followed Newtonian orbits as expected.  
- Symplectic integration worked as expected in a Hamiltonian framework.  

### New Question  
- Can we adapt this approach for a purely kinematic system, where motion emerges from energy transfers instead of force equations?

## 3. Let’s Try It: Adapting Rebound to a Purely Kinematic System  

### Hypothesis
- If motion is driven by energy redistribution, symplectic integration should still ensure:
  - Energy conservation  
  - Stable numerical evolution  
  - Emergent time and motion  

### Key Modifications  
- Replaced forces with energy redistribution  
- Defined elements as energy nodes, not mass-based bodies  
- State evolution depended only on energy transfers  
- Used symplectic integration to track energy flows over time

## 4. Code Implementation  

### Simulation Setup  
```python
import rebound

sim = rebound.Simulation()
sim.integrator = "whfast"  # Symplectic integrator for energy conservation
sim.dt = 1e-3  # Small timestep for energy redistribution

# Adding computational elements as energy nodes
sim.add(m=1.0, x=0, y=0, z=0, vx=0, vy=0, vz=0)  # Reference frame node
sim.add(m=0.5, x=1, y=0, z=0, vx=0.1, vy=0, vz=0)  # Energy-exchanging element
```

### Energy Redistribution Instead of Forces  
```python
# Function to define energy transfer
def energy_transfer(sim):
    particles = sim.particles
    for i in range(1, len(particles)):  
        delta_energy = 0.01 * particles[i].m  # Small energy transfer
        particles[i].m -= delta_energy
        particles[0].m += delta_energy  # Redistribution to another element

sim.additional_forces = energy_transfer  # Attach to simulation
```

### Running the Simulation  
```python
sim.integrate(100)  # Run for 100 time units

# Output final state to verify energy conservation
for i, p in enumerate(sim.particles):
    print(f"Element {i}: Energy (m) = {p.m}")
```

## 5. Expected Outcomes  
- Total energy conservation should hold, even without force-driven equations  
- Symplectic integration should ensure stable energy redistribution  
- Motion should emerge naturally without force-based acceleration  

---

## 6. Results: Emergent Motion and Energy Conservation  

### Key Findings  
- Energy Conservation Was Preserved  
  - System maintained its total energy sum without force equations.  

- Time Evolution Followed Natural Patterns  
  - State changes were smooth and structured, even without force-based rules.  

- Path Selection Resembled Least-Action Dynamics  
  - Energy redistribution caused self-organizing motion without predefined accelerations.  

- Symplectic Integration Prevented Numerical Drift  
  - No cumulative errors in energy evolution, unlike naive numerical methods.

## 7. Why This Matters: Implications for Computational Physics  

### Key Insights  
- Symplectic methods work beyond Hamiltonian systems  
  - They stabilize energy-driven kinematic models without forces.  

- Energy evolution alone can drive motion  
  - State changes followed least-action behavior even without explicit force gradients.  

- Time can emerge from energy propagation  
  - System evolved without predefined time steps or an external clock.  

- Potential applications in physics and computation  
  - General relativity (geodesic motion without force laws).  
  - Quantum mechanics (energy-driven state evolution).  
  - Emergent spacetime models (where time is a function of energy flow).

## 8. Conclusion: A Viable Path for Kinematic-Only Lagrangian Simulations  

### Final Takeaways  
- Energy conservation, time emergence, and least-action motion held under a purely kinematic framework  
- Symplectic integration maintained stability without needing Hamiltonian phase-space definitions  
- Opens new possibilities for energy-based computational physics models  

### Next Steps  
- Expand the model to test more complex energy interactions  
- Compare symplectic integrators (SEI, IAS15) for performance differences  
- Investigate applications in quantum/classical hybrid models  

### Final Thought  
This experiment reinforces the idea that motion, time, and state transitions can emerge from energy interactions alone—suggesting new ways to simulate physics without traditional force-based mechanics.
