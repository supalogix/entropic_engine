# Validating the Use of C Instead of Python for Rebound Simulations  

## 1. Overview  

### Objective  
- Assess whether C can outperform Python for Rebound simulations.  
- Validate if parallelism, memory efficiency, and assembly optimizations provide measurable speedups.  
- Determine if inline assembly and SIMD acceleration can further enhance performance.  

### Why This Matters  
- Python’s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limits true parallel execution.  
- C provides fine-grained control over memory and computation, potentially improving efficiency.  
- Inline assembly and SIMD (AVX/SSE) optimizations could provide additional speedups.

## 2. Experiment Design  

### Comparison Setup  
- **Python Setup:**  
  - Standard Rebound installation using Python bindings.  
  - Uses NumPy for vectorized computations where possible.  
  - Runs in single-threaded mode due to Python’s GIL limitations.  
- **C Setup:**  
  - Implemented Rebound in C with OpenMP for parallel execution.  
  - SIMD vectorization applied to force calculations and collision handling.  
  - Manual memory allocation with `malloc/free`.  
  - Inline assembly for optimized math operations.  

### Key Performance Metrics  
- Execution time: Compare simulation speed in Python vs. C.  
- Memory usage: Measure memory allocation efficiency.  
- Scalability: Test how well each implementation scales with increasing particles.  
- Parallelism efficiency: Evaluate speedup when using multiple threads/cores.
